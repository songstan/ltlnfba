The LTL2BA software was written by Denis Oddoux and modified by Paul

	in 13th International Conference on Computer Aided Verification, CAV 2001,

2. COMPILING

open the archive :
> gunzip ltlnfba.tar.gz
> tar xf ltlnfba.tar
> cd ltlnfba

compile the program
> make

3. EXECUTING

run the program
> ./ltlnfba -f "formula"

The formula is an LTL formula, and may contain propositional symbols, 
boolean operators, temporal operators, and parentheses.
The syntax used is the one used in the 'Spin' model-checker

Propositonal Symbols:
        true, false
	any lowercase string

Boolean operators:
        !   (negation)
        ->  (implication)
	<-> (equivalence)
        &&  (and)
        ||  (or)

Temporal operators:
        []  (always)
        <>  (eventually)
        U   (until)
        V   (release)
        X   (next)

Use spaces between any symbols.

The result is a never claim in Promela that can be given to the
Spin model checker to verify properties on a system.

> ./ltlnfba
